Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.

    <h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
    <p>MALEi Business came into existence after it was realized that the majority 
      of people were having it hard going to cyber cafes for online services. 
      This proved to be a hard task for many, not forgetting the queues they had 
      to make to get a service. This could lead to spending alot of time just waiting 
      to be attended to and sometimes following unreliable electricity power issues 
      one could end up not being attended to despite the urgency of their needs. 
      For this reason, MALEI Business was started as a solution in 2019 as MALEI Cyberspace, 
      which later changed to MALEI Business in November 2021.
    </p>
